# Recursion

To check if a word is a palindrome, you can use the following algorithm:

Read the word input.
Initialize two pointers, start and end, pointing to the first and last characters of the word, respectively.
While start is less than or equal to end:
Compare the characters at positions start and end.
If they are equal, move start one position forward and end one position backward.
If they are not equal, the word is not a palindrome.
If the loop completes without finding any unequal characters, the word is a palindrome.
